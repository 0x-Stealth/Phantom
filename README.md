# Phantom

Phantom is a Python RAT Controlled by a Discord Bot, made due to the lack of good ones.

Of course, Pysillion exists, however that is notoriously buggy. 

This aims to fix all the issues of Pysillion, while trying to keep detectons down.

### Please note ***I am making this for fun, not to be a good project. Of course, it'll be decent, but don't expect a nice readme yet.***
## Roadmap

### Release
- General bot working-ness addition.

- Add the main commands you need, eg shell execution, shit like that

### Version One

- Add more browser support.

- Add the more funny trolling commands

### At 25 stars, add more features like Shellcode Execution, Rootkits, Persistence etc.


## Final Notes:
This projec is **not** correlated with Serpent.
